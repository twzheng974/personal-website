*Sorry for the lack of pictures in this post, I did not consider documenting this when I started.*

This Black Friday, I bought a magnetic conversion kit and a set of stickers from SpeedCubeShop to upgrade my Gans 356 speedcube. It arrived two days ago (November 29, 2017), but my focus was on my new Surface Book (2015 model; i5/8GB/dGPU), so I did not begin until that night. 

I started by using a plastic blade to remove all the stickers. All the stickers were easily removed, but the blue side left a thin layer of adhesive. Luckily, isopropol alcohol was able to wipe it all clean.

Next, it was time to disassembling my cube. Since there are metallic pieces within the cube, I could not rinse all the pieces off. Each cubelet is held together by a screw, and the centers contains a washer and a spring. Additionally, the core has 6 axes protruding from a plastic piece, one for each face of a cube. In total, there were 90 plastic pieces, 32 metal pieces, and the core.

I dumped all of the plastic pieces into a bucket of soap water to wash off the silicon lubricant and other gunk from two years of use. Afterwards, I neatly laid out all the pieces on a paper towel to dry overnight.
