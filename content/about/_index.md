My name is Jimmy Zheng, and this is my website.


I am a Chinese American and a high school senior, living in North Carolina, USA. I love doing math, speedcubing, yoyoing, and playing video games. I plan to major in Computer Science. I collected over 20 twisty puzzles and am currently growing my yoyo collection, which is featured on this site. I also enjoy tinkering with computer hardware, as long as it has little to no value.
