      <description>Sorry for the lack of pictures in this post, I did not consider documenting this when I started.
This Black Friday, I bought a magnetic conversion kit and a set of stickers from SpeedCubeShop to upgrade my Gans 356 speedcube. It arrived two days ago (November 29, 2017), but my focus was on my new Surface Book (2015 model; i5/8GB/dGPU), so I did not begin until that night.
I started by using a plastic blade to remove all the stickers.</description>
